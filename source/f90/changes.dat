Changes in the param.dat file. Mainly to:
 Increase runoff, by reducing
the amount of increased capacity upto a fraction of saturation.
 Increase biomass, by reducing litter (stlit in 'growth.for').
increasing stem npp and reducing root litter decay (rl 0.8->0.5 in MKLIT in 'growth.for').
 Decrease productivity by reducing VMAX 17->11.
 Decrease the assimilation temperature differential by Q10 value in NPPCLAC.for 
3->2.3.










**********************************************

Changed (E13.6 to (E14.6 in SDGVM0.f. This stops numbers running
into each other when -ve's occur. Negatives shouldn't occur, but
they can with spurious input data.


Stopped growing leaves when very low soil moisture
      &(dsbb.GT.bb2bbmax)) THEN
becomes
      &((dsbb.GT.bb2bbmax).AND.(soil2g.GT.half+0.2d0*(wtfc-half)))) THEN
in phenology 1 & 2

Commented out the ppm death thingy 1700ish. This caused a problem when
restarting with the input files every year in the imogen runs.
These values will naturaly get set to zero in COVER.
Resetting them prematurely like this causes a problem.
This only happens when restarting at a site where death has occured.

          DO age=1,ftmor(ft)
*            IF (ppm(age,ft).LT.1.0e-16) then
*              cov(age,ft)=0.0
*              bio(age,1,ft)=0.0
*              bio(age,2,ft)=0.0
*              hgt(age,ft)=0.0
*              wdt(age,ft)=0.0
*            ENDIF
            ftcov(ft) = ftcov(ft) + cov(age,ft)
          ENDDO

Added function check_ft_grow to func.f. This function checks to see
whether the temperature bb limit will be reached. If not then the
new ground is set to BARE ground. The function is called in sdgvm0.f.
This prevents trying to grow vegetation where none can ever exist
in cold regions. 

Put the files country.dat and country_id.dat in the data directory.
This saves carting the files around with every version of sdgvm.
Also the added problem that they are only read at run time and so
have to exist in the executable directory is solved.
The directory where the country files and the land sea mask is given
by the line that was previously used for the land sea mask.

The above problem with misc_params.dat has also been solved by using
default screen output options when the file doesn't exist.

So now the only file required with the executable is param.dat.
After discusion with Marc, I've decided that its best to keep things
like this. Its safe anyway with the version check that was introduced
recently.

Put a fix in subroutine dolymonth (doly.f) to stop negative soil respiration
occuring. This could occur in a ft vegetation restart as the carbon 
needed to seed the vegetation is taken from the surface litter.
This can leed to the surface litter pool being negative.
If this pool becomes negative, I know set it to zero and take the
deficit proportionately from all the carbon pools.

Fixed snapshots. There was a problem with the filenames.
Included 1190ish
      st4=in2st(snpshts(i))
      CALL STRIPB(st4)

Altered the output file 'biot.dat' to include nppstore.
Altered the output file 'soilc.dat' to include surface and root litter
which has not yet been put into the soil litter pools.
The two changes above ensure that 
nbp.dat(n+1) = biot(n+1)+scn(n+1)-(biot(n+1)+scn(n+1))
Just as it should be.

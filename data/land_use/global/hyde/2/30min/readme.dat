The data set consists of a landuse file named 'landuse.dat'.Records in 
each file have fields containing latitude and longitude, at the centre
of the pixel, and data values, the number of which will correspond to 
the number of fields in 'years of landuse' above. Records must run 
consecutively from west to east starting at the northern most latitude,
for any given area made up of a rectangle of pixels defined above. The 
format of each record must be '(f7.3,f9.3,NYEARSi3)'. Location is inferred 
from position in the file not the latitude and longitude values, these
are redundent but values must be present.

The landuse classification scheme is given below.

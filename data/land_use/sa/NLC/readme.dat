Hi

As promised - here are the www links for the NLC data.

The Final report on the NLC mapping project can be found here - and is very
useful.

http://www.csir.co.za/websource/ptl0002/docs/sac/nlc_report_2004.html 

The illustrated field guide designed for use by fieldworkers, and which
really defines the land-cover classes well, can be found here - and should
give you all the info you need to re-classify the classes.

Hope that this is useful

Regards

Robbo

The data set consists of soil texture, depth, and bulk density.
Records in each file have ten fields corresponding to
latitude, longitude, sand %, silt %, bulk density (g/cm-3), organic C %,
wilting point 0-1, field capacity 0-1, saturated water content 0-1 
and soil depth (cm).
Records must run from west to east starting at the northern most
latitude, for any given area made up of a rectangle of pixels defined
above. The format of each record must be '(f7.3,f9.3,8f10.4)'
Note that location is inferred from position in the file not the 
latitude and longitude values, these are redundent but values must 
be present.

York soil carbon/texture data:
Andreas Heinemeyer
last updated (possible changes to files!) 21/01/2004
>>>21.01.04:	10 min grid mistakes corrected.

Please read this information BEFORE using any of the data!

Data have been commisioned by DEFRA.
CTCD got access to the soil CARBON data for the entire UK from June 2003 onwards for about 5 years.
CTCD has access to the soil TEXTURE data for England and Wales (incl. Northern Ireland) ONLY!
So far, Scottish data still need to be excluded from any analysis.
However, if you find any Scottish soil texture data points which have been missed out please delete them immediately
and notify Andreas Heinemeyer ah126@york.ac.uk.

I have written a SAS programme caluclating weighted means for individual 1km grid cell values.
Furthermore, i have incorporated those data into GIS (ArcView3.x). This is available on request.
I have also access to a calculation for 10min grid overlay calculation for SDGVM compatibility.


The database behind the presented .txt files was as following:

(i)
GB_landuse file:

EAST,NORTH,ARABLE,GARDEN,NATURAL,OTHER,PASTURE,SEA,TREES,URBAN,WATER,NON-CORINE

I have excluded values for "other, sea, urban, water and non-corine" 
and have combined "Garden and Pasture" and left "Arable and Natural and Trees" as following:

	ARAB	=ARABLE;
	GRASS	=GARDEN+PASTURE;
	WOOD	=TREES;
	SEMI	=NATURAL;

DROP command:	OTHER SEA URBAN WATER NONCORINE ;

(ii)
GB_parameter:

SERIES, AR30C, AR100C, PG30C, PG100C, SE30C, SE100C, WO30C, WO100C,
(ie Arable, Permanent Grassland, Seminatural, Woodland)
(for texture this further included: %clay30, %silt30, %sand30, Bulkdensity30, %clay100, %silt100, %sand100, Bulkdensity100)
(for 100cm texture data I calcualted a weighted mean of the two values ie soil depth!)
(if only 30cm data given then this was assumed to be true for 100cm as well.)

This file contains the parameter for each soil series as carbon (kg m^2) for both 30cm and 30-100cm horizons
for the 4 landuse types. The sum of the two horizons thus equals 100cm horizon depth.
Missing values (lots!) as 999. However, whenever there was at least one parameter given,
I have substituted the missing value with the mean of the known ones.
I have used these values in a weighted means analaysis. This analaysis enabled to calculate
one carbon value for each 1km grid cell taking into account different area coverage of individual landuse. 

(iii)
GB_series file:

EAST,NORTH,SERIES1,SERIES1_PC,SERIES2,SERIES2_PC,SERIES3,SERIES3_PC,SERIES4,SERIES4_PC,SERIES5,SERIES5_PC,OTHERPC

This file on a UK 1km grid reference contains up to 5 soil series numbers with the individual percentage values.
I have used these values in a weighted means analaysis. This analaysis enabled to calculate one carbon value for each
1km grid cell taking into account
different area coverage of individual area coverage for soil series.

Data structure:

All files as tab limited files with 999 as missing values.


1. CTCDall_carbsoil10mina.txt

This is the SDGVM compatible 10min grid (lat long). Soil carbon and texture data (% Clay, Sand silt and bulk density values)
are given for either 30cm or 100cm horizon calulations. 
All grid values have been calcualated as mean (avg) values for each grid cell (approx. 100 1km rgid values).


The DATA:
Colums:
Lat	Lon	Carb30_Avg	Carb1m_Avg	Clay30_Avg	Sand30_Avg	Silt30_Avg	Bulkd30_Avg	Clay1m_Avg	Sand1m_Avg	Silt1m_Avg	Bulkd1m_Avg


2. E&Wcarbsoil 1km.txt

This is the 1km UK easting (x) northing (y) grid for GB carbon and soil texture (see above) vlaues at 1km resolution
(still excluding NI).
Values have been given as either 30cm or 100cm profile depth according to the DEFRA choosen horizons, compatible with
the Roth C model.

Columns:
x	y	Carb30	Carb1m	Clay30	Sand30	Silt30	Bulkd30	Clay1m	Sand1m	Silt1m	Bulkd1m


3. UKcarb30_100.txt

THis is the 1km UK easting northing grid for GB carbon vlaues at 1km resolution (still excluding NI).
Values have been given as either 30cm or 100cm profile depth according to the DEFRA choosen horizons,
compatible with the Roth C model.

Columns:
x y carb30 carb100

Hi mark,

Had to redo the data... :(

Columns in tab limited format ... no missing values but some grid cells 
(I think 4 or 5) did not have any data?!

i think the data are easy to understand, but please note that 'Country' 
is not important and 'Coutnry_Count' is the number of 1km grid cells 
used for the average; car is the %org.C in each layer. Also '30' 
indicates 0-30 cm soil depth and '1m' indicates 0-100cm soil depth. So 
we can do it for two runs.

Hope this makes sense and the grid is OK and in the correct place!!!
Thanks,
Andreas
